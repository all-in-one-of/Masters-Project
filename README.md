## Release History

# Developing Stages

* Submission_01 : This file has the initial model of having particles.
   
* Submission_02: This file has particles running over through a path.
    * NOTE: The path.obj and ooo.obj must be imported. 
   
File with rendered sequence working. Each file has its parameters like force modified to show different amounts of variation in the particles movement.

* Submission_03A: All particles spread widely

* Submission_03B: Movement is restricted a bit

* Submission_03C:  Movement is tight

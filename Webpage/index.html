<h2>Abstract</h2>

Houdini gives the simple user different methods for creating visually interesting environmental effects . In this program, three different types of objects  simulation are shown: a collection of /textbf{soft objects simulation, hard objects and very hard objects}. This paper presents an effective method to simulate the ball diffusion process in real time to produce realistic movements. A group of objects that interact with an object, to enhance the particle motion effects, a force is required . This force might not be physically accurate, but it proves effective for producing animations.
